Legal Hackers is a global movement of lawyers, policymakers, technologists and academics, who explore and develop creative solutions to some of the most pressing issues at the intersection of law and technology.

Drawing from the MIT “hack” culture as playful, creative exploration of potential solutions to problems, Legalhackers develop innovative technical solutions to legal problems.  Legal hackers have a strong technical bent and often focus on the legal implications of technology, or the use of technology to faciitate legal.  

Legal hackers share a commitment to explore, be open, and be innovative.  That committment is reflected in a strong respect for diversity among ideas and participants.  

Legal hackers embrace open versus closed modes of thinking.
